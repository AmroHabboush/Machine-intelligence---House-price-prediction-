# Machine-intelligence---House-price-prediction-
House price prediction using machine learning and deep learning.
Customer retention is important in a variety of businesses as acquiring new customers is 
often more costly than keeping the current ones. Therefore, churn prediction has 
attracted great attention from both the business and academic worlds.
We found a dataset for this topic by a bank manager that is facing an issue that more and 
more consumers are canceling their credit card services.
So, we are going to make a ML project that can predict who would cancel their credit card 
so that the bank would go out of their way and deliver decent support and influence 
consumers' choices in the opposite direction.
The main purpose of this project is to maintain the number of customers by making a 
useful pattern of their behavior based on the dataset we have; we will try to take the 
process on its simplest scale by classifying the Dataset that contains 10.000 customers’ 
information and make conclusions from it so the model will warn us before any customer 
may cancel their card.
We will use around 75% for learning purposes, the other 25% we will try to find the 
accuracy of our model.
